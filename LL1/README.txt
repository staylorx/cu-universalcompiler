Hi.

This runs on node 6.5.0.

To setup dependencies:

  npm update
  
To run the code:

  cd app
  node parserRun8.js 1

There are three program strings. Change the number in 'node parserRun8.js <this-number-here>' to run the string.

The same code is run for assignment 9 except the program is parserRun9.js:

  cd app
  node parserRun9.js 1
  
I think it's handy to send it to a file:

  node parserRun9.js 1 > output9-1.txt

Thanks!
